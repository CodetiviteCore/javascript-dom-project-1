## ToDo:
- Change the background image to a white and black version of your favorite image. (You may get extra bonus for using your face)

- Your version of the keyboard will have all the letters (A - Z) and number keys (0 - 9) on your keyboard. Get free sounds from ZapSplat

- While the letter keys can play any sound you want, the number keys should play different animal sounds when hit
Create a light mode/ dark mode for your application
